# 0.1.3 Features / Changelog

## Major features

* New algorithms added to crypto/ (PR #89):
    * sm3 -- the SM3 hash (GB/T 32905-2016 / ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018), ported from bc-java. Implements `Hash`,
      `Suspendable` and `AlgorithmOID`, supports bit-oriented (partial final byte) messages per GB/T 32905-2016 s. 5.2
      with the partial byte in ASN.1 BIT STRING order like SHA-2/SHA-3, and is registered in `HashFactory`
      (`"SM3"`) with a `bc-rust sm3` CLI subcommand.
    * HMAC-SM3, in the hmac crate, registered in `MACFactory` (`"HMAC-SM3"`) with a `bc-rust hmac-sm3` CLI subcommand.
    * Test vectors are the GB/T 32905-2016 Appendix A examples plus the bc-java `SM3DigestTest` / `HMac` vectors, with
      additional digests cross-checked against OpenSSL and bc-java.

New crate `bouncycastle-aes` (`bouncycastle::aes`): AES-128/192/256 as a raw keyed block
permutation (NIST FIPS 197), re-exported from the umbrella crate.

* **Constant-time and table-free.** The S-box is evaluated as a Boolean circuit -- the 113-gate Boyar-Peralta
  straight-line program, 32 AND / 77 XOR / 4 XNOR -- over eight `u32` bit-planes, so there is no secret-indexed
  memory access and no secret-dependent branch anywhere, including in the key schedule. A table-driven "light"
  AES that removes the tables only from the cipher still leaks through `SUBWORD()` in the expansion.
* **Low memory.** No lookup tables at all (0 bytes, against 512 bytes for BC Java's `AESLightEngine` and 2-8 KiB
  for T-table engines) and no heap allocation. The only persistent state is the key schedule, stored bit-sliced
  in a compressed form that is exactly the FIPS 197 Sec 5.2 size: `AES_128` 176 B, `AES_192` 208 B, `AES_256` 240 B.
* **Both directions from one value.** Decryption follows FIPS 197 Algorithm 3 (the straight inverse cipher) rather
  than the equivalent inverse cipher of Sec 5.3.5, so it uses the unmodified key schedule -- one stored schedule
  encrypts and decrypts, with no second copy and no transformation at construction time.
* **Two-block entry points.** The bit-sliced state holds two blocks, so `encrypt_2blocks` / `decrypt_2blocks` are
  the natural unit of work and roughly double single-block throughput. `encrypt_block` / `decrypt_block` are
  provided but do twice the necessary work; modes whose blocks are independent (CTR, and CBC/CFB decryption)
  should prefer the pair form.
* Verified against FIPS 197 Appendix A.1/A.2/A.3 (every schedule word), FIPS 197 Appendix B, an exhaustive check
  of all 256 S-box and inverse S-box inputs against Tables 4 and 6, SP 800-38A Appendix F.1 (ECB, all three key
  lengths, both directions), and 2138 NIST ACVP `ACVP-AES-ECB` cases from `bc-test-data` (skipped with a warning
  if that repository is not checked out).
* Deliberately ships no CLI subcommand, no factory entry and no `core` cipher-trait impls: a raw permutation can
  only offer ECB, and those are mode-of-operation concerns. `Algorithm` is implemented (name and security
  strength); per-mode OIDs and the `BlockCipherEncryptor` / `BlockCipherDecryptor` impls belong to the mode crates.
* Ships the type aliases `AES_CBC_128` / `AES_CBC_192` / `AES_CBC_256`, `AES_CFB_128` /
  `AES_CFB_192` / `AES_CFB_256`, `AES_CFB8_128` / `AES_CFB8_192` / `AES_CFB8_256`,
  `AES_CTR_128` / `AES_CTR_192` / `AES_CTR_256` (12-byte nonce, 4-byte counter) and
  `AES_ECB_128` / `AES_ECB_192` / `AES_ECB_256`, which fill in the
  const parameters of `bouncycastle-modes`' `Cbc`, `Cfb`, `Cfb8`, `Ctr` and `Ecb`. The three stream
  modes leave the direction as the only type parameter; the two **block** modes, CBC and ECB, take
  a padding scheme as well -- `AES_CBC_128<Encrypting, PKCS7>` -- because neither is defined on data
  that is not a whole number of blocks, so the scheme is a choice the caller has to make and one
  both ends must agree on. Naming it in the type makes a mismatched pair a compile error instead of
  a decryption that returns plausible rubbish. `PaddedMode` is the crate-internal projection that lets a single
  alias carry both parameters, `PaddedEncryptor` and `PaddedDecryptor` being distinct types. They are aliases only -- no new engine
  code, and each one's doctest round-trips and shows that a misaligned length fails to compile.

New crate `bouncycastle-modes` (`bouncycastle::modes`): cipher modes of operation
(NIST SP 800-38A), providing **CBC** (Sec 6.2), **CFB128** and **CFB8** (Sec 6.3, `s = b` and
`s = 8`), **CTR** (Sec 6.5) and **ECB** (Sec 6.1) -- four of the recommendation's five modes, with
only OFB outstanding. Re-exported from the umbrella crate.

* `Cbc`, `Cfb`, `Cfb8` and `Ecb`, each `<P, Dir, KEY_LEN, BLOCK_LEN>`, and `Ctr`, which takes a
  nonce length as a fifth parameter, over any
  `ElectronicCodeBook`, so the crate depends on no concrete cipher. The direction is a type parameter:
  the encryptor trait is implemented only for `<_, Encrypting, _, _>` and the decryptor trait
  only for `<_, Decrypting, _, _>`, making a wrong-direction call a compile error rather than a
  runtime check.
* **Block modes and stream modes.** `Cbc` and `Ecb` are block ciphers
  (`BlockCipherEncryptor` / `BlockCipherDecryptor`): whole blocks in, whole blocks out, with
  arbitrary-length data going through `bouncycastle-padding`. `Cfb`, `Cfb8` and `Ctr` are stream
  ciphers (`StreamCipherEncryptor` / `StreamCipherDecryptor`): any length in, the same length out,
  no padding layer and no finalization step. That split follows SP 800-38A Sec 5.2, which requires a
  multiple of the *block* size only for ECB and CBC, a multiple of the *segment* size `s` for CFB,
  and nothing at all for CTR ("the plaintext need not be a multiple of the block size").
* **The IV is generated, never accepted.** SP 800-38A Sec 5.3 requires the CBC *and CFB* IV to be
  *unpredictable*, not merely unique, so `do_encrypt_init` draws one from the library's default
  OS-backed DRBG (Appendix C's second recommended method) and returns it; there is no API for
  supplying your own. Known-answer tests drive `do_encrypt_init_rng` with a fixed-output test RNG.
  This matters more for CFB than for CBC: CFB XORs a keystream, so a repeated key-and-IV pair leaks
  `P1 XOR P1'` outright rather than merely whether the blocks were equal.
* **Parallel decryption.** Sec 6.2 notes CBC decryption's inverse cipher calls can run in
  parallel, so `do_decrypt_blocks` walks the ciphertext in fours through
  `ElectronicCodeBook::decrypt_4blocks`, then pairs through `decrypt_2blocks`, then a one-block
  remainder. A toy permutation that rotates its four results proves the four path is taken, and
  only for full fours. Measured against an
  otherwise identical permutation that does not override the pair methods, this is **1.83x** the
  decryption throughput (67.9 vs 37.1 MiB/s, AES-128, 16 KiB, N=8). CBC encryption is serial by
  construction and does not use it.
* Strictly block-aligned, as Sec 5.2 requires of CBC. Arbitrary-length data goes through
  `bouncycastle-padding`'s `PaddedEncryptor` / `PaddedDecryptor`, which wrap either mode; no padding
  logic lives in this crate. `crypto/modes/tests/cfb_tests.rs` round-trips every length from 0 to
  `3 * BLOCK_LEN + 1` through PKCS7 to pin that the two crates compose.
* Verified against all six SP 800-38A Appendix F.2 vectors (CBC-AES128/192/256, Encrypt and
  Decrypt), each checked in one call, one block at a time, in a `3 + 1` grouping that exercises the
  pair remainder, and through the `_out` variant. Appendix D error propagation is tested
  exhaustively for the IV (every one of the 128 bit positions flips exactly its own bit of P1) and
  for a ciphertext bit error (affects exactly two blocks).
* Also verified against the **2150 NIST ACVP `ACVP-AES-CBC` AFT cases** from `bc-test-data` (all
  three key lengths, both directions, 60 of them spanning 2-10 blocks). Each case is run twice --
  block by block, and in pairs with a one-block remainder -- so the `decrypt_2blocks` path is
  exercised against real vectors, not only against the toy permutation. Unlike the ECB response
  file, the CBC one carries only the answer against a `tcId`, so the request and response files are
  joined; the 6 MCT groups are skipped and the count reported. These vectors were already in
  `bc-test-data` and previously unused.
CFB128 (`Cfb`), SP 800-38A Sec 6.3 with `s = b`:

* **A stream cipher.** Sec 6.3 parameterises CFB by a segment size `s` with `1 <= s <= b`, and
  `Cfb` implements `s = b` -- CFB128 for AES. With `s = b` the spec's
  `LSB_{b-s}(I_{j-1}) | C#_{j-1}` collapses to `Ij = C_{j-1}` and `MSB_s(Oj)` to `Oj`, which the
  module docs derive step by step. CFB never puts the data through the cipher, only the input
  block, so `Cfb` implements `StreamCipherEncryptor` / `StreamCipherDecryptor`: a `&mut [u8]` of
  any length, in place, chunked however the caller likes, with no padding layer.
* **The short final segment.** Sec 5.2 defines CFB only on a multiple of `s`, and Appendix A puts
  padding outside the recommendation's scope. Rather than reject a message that is not a whole
  number of blocks, `Cfb` takes the `s = 8r` step of the Sec 6.3 equations for the last segment
  alone -- `C#_n = P#_n XOR MSB_{8r}(On)` -- discarding the rest of `On` exactly as Sec 6.3
  discards `b - s` bits of every output block when `s < b`. No input block is formed after the last
  segment, so the feedback rule that distinguishes `s < b` from `s = b` is never reached and the
  result is unambiguous. This is what streaming CFB128 implementations do in practice, and the
  ciphertexts interoperate: checked byte for byte against OpenSSL's `EVP_aes_128_cfb128` on a
  37-byte message, in both directions.
* **One buffer, three roles.** Within a segment the single stored block holds the ciphertext
  produced so far and the unused tail of `Oj` at once -- each ciphertext byte is written over the
  keystream byte that produced it, and is exactly what the next input block wants in that position
  -- so the same 16 bytes are the input block, then the output block, then the next input block,
  with no copy and no second buffer. That costs one `usize` over `Cbc` (200/232/264 B for
  AES-128/192/256) to record how much of the current segment has been used.
* **Decryption uses the forward cipher function.** Sec 6.3 applies `CIPH_K` in both directions, so
  `Cfb<_, Decrypting, _, _>` never calls `decrypt_block` or `decrypt_2blocks`. This is pinned by a
  test permutation whose inverse methods panic, run over both the pair and single-block paths -- so
  the claim is enforced rather than merely documented.
* **Parallel decryption**, via `encrypt_4blocks` / `encrypt_2blocks` (fours, then pairs, then a single block, like CBC): Sec 6.3 notes CFB decryption's forward cipher
  calls "can be performed in parallel if the input blocks are first constructed (in series) from the
  IV and the ciphertext", and with `s = b` those input blocks simply *are* the IV followed by the
  ciphertext. Re-measured after the stream-cipher rewrite: against an otherwise identical
  permutation that does not override the pair methods, this is **1.96x** the decryption throughput
  (106.8 vs 54.6 MiB/s, AES-128, 16 KiB, N=8). In the same run CFB decryption was **1.26x** CBC
  decryption (106.8 vs 84.9 MiB/s), because the bit-sliced engine's forward direction is cheaper
  than its inverse and CFB only ever needs the forward one. CFB encryption is serial by
  construction and does not use the pair path -- verified, not assumed: the swapped-pair test
  permutation produces identical ciphertext under `Cfb` encrypt.
* **The byte path is close to free on encryption and modest on decryption.** Calls that are not a
  whole number of blocks end mid-segment and the next call finishes that segment byte by byte. At
  125-byte calls (7 blocks and 13 bytes) encryption measured 51.1 MiB/s against 51.4 for
  block-aligned calls, and decryption 90.6 against 106.8 -- the decrypt side pays because a partial
  segment at each end of a call breaks the four-block batch.
* Verified against all six SP 800-38A **Appendix F.3.13-F.3.18** vectors (CFB128-AES128/192/256,
  Encrypt and Decrypt) in the same four groupings as CBC. F.3 additionally tabulates the *output
  blocks* -- the keystream -- so those are checked against the raw permutation too
  (`Oj == CIPH_K(I_j)` and `Cj == Pj XOR Oj` for all four segments of all three key lengths), which
  pins the mode's internals and not just its final output. As a transcription cross-check, CFB128
  is required to agree with **Appendix F.4.1 (OFB)** on the first block -- both compute
  `C1 = P1 XOR CIPH_K(IV)` -- and to disagree from the second.
* Also verified against the **2138 NIST ACVP `ACVP-AES-CFB128` AFT cases** from `bc-test-data` (all
  three key lengths, both directions, 54 of them spanning 2-10 blocks), each run in four groupings:
  block by block, in pairs with a remainder, as one call over the whole payload, and in 5-byte
  calls that never line up with a block, so the byte path is exercised against real vectors with a
  segment left open across calls. The 6 MCT groups are skipped and the count reported. These
  vectors were already in `bc-test-data` and previously unused.
* Appendix D error propagation is tested in the direction that distinguishes CFB from CBC. Table D.2
  gives CFB "SBE in the decryption of Cj": every one of the 128 bit positions of `C2` is flipped and
  required to flip *exactly* that bit of `P2` (the block the attacker aimed at, unlike CBC where it
  lands in `P3`), to randomise `P3`, and to leave `P1` and `P4` untouched. The IV case is checked
  with real AES, where a corrupted IV must *randomise* `P1` rather than flip a bit in place, and
  must not affect any later block -- with `s = b`, Appendix D's "first `i/s` (rounding up)"
  segments is one segment for every bit position.
* Mutation-tested: `cargo mutants -p bouncycastle-modes` reports **0 surviving mutants** across
  the whole crate (220 mutants, 108 caught, 112 unviable, 0 missed, 0 timed out) -- 45 caught in
  `ctr.rs`, 28 in `cfb.rs`, 16 in `cbc.rs`, 14 in `cfb8.rs`, 2 each in `ecb.rs` and `iv.rs` --
  including every `^`-to-`|`/`&` substitution and every keystream-stubbing mutant in the three
  keystream modes. One mutant needed the tests to reach past runtime behaviour: stubbing out CTR's
  compile-time counter-width guard cannot fail any runtime test, so the `compile_fail` doctests on
  `Ctr` are what kill it.
* Still not implemented, and listed in the crate docs: **CFB1** (`s = 1`), whose segment is a
  single bit rather than a whole number of bytes and so does not fit a byte-oriented API at all,
  and **OFB** and **CTR**.

CFB8 (`Cfb8`), SP 800-38A Sec 6.3 with `s = 8`:

* **A different mode, not a variant.** `Cfb8` is its own type, because CFB8 and CFB128 are not
  interoperable: they agree on the first byte of ciphertext -- `P1 XOR MSB_8(CIPH_K(IV))` in both --
  and diverge from the second, since `s = b` replaces the whole input block with the ciphertext
  block while `s = 8` shifts one byte into a register. Both the type docs and the CLI help say so,
  and a test asserts exactly that agree-then-diverge pattern rather than merely that the outputs
  differ.
* **The shift register is the spec's own alternative description.** `I_{j+1} = LSB_{b-8}(Ij) | Cj`
  is implemented as `rotate_left(1)` followed by writing the ciphertext byte into the last
  position, which is Sec 6.3's "the bits of the first input block circularly shift s positions to
  the left, and then the ciphertext segment replaces the s least significant bits of the result",
  in that order. `MSB_8(Oj)` is the first byte of the output block; the other `b - 8` are
  discarded, as Sec 6.3 requires.
* **A stream cipher with a one-byte segment**, so every byte string is a valid message: no
  alignment rule, no padding, no partial-segment state. Same size as `Cbc` (192/224/256 B for
  AES-128/192/256).
* **One forward cipher per byte.** Discarding 15 of every 16 output bytes is what the mode costs:
  encryption measured **3.41 MiB/s** against CFB128's 51.4 on the same data and cipher, a factor of
  15. That is inherent to `s = 8`, and the crate docs, the type docs and the CLI help all say to
  prefer `Cfb` unless a byte-granular self-synchronising stream is required or a format demands
  CFB8.
* **Decryption still batches.** Sec 6.3's parallel decryption applies: the successive register
  states depend only on the IV and the ciphertext, so they are built in series -- byte shuffling,
  no cipher calls -- and the forward ciphers then run four at a time through `encrypt_4blocks`,
  then in pairs. Measured **1.94x** the throughput of the same decryption in 1-byte calls, which
  never batch (6.61 vs 3.40 MiB/s). Encryption cannot batch and does not.
* **Decryption never calls the inverse cipher**, as in CFB128, pinned by the same test permutation
  whose inverse methods panic, run over the four-block, pair and single-byte paths.
* Verified against all six SP 800-38A **Appendix F.3.7-F.3.12** vectors (CFB8-AES128/192/256,
  Encrypt and Decrypt), each in seven groupings from one byte per call up to the whole message.
  F.3.7's tabulated **input and output blocks** -- all 18 of each -- are checked three ways: that
  each input block is the previous one shifted with the ciphertext byte appended, that each output
  block is `CIPH_K` of it through the raw permutation, and that `Cj == Pj XOR MSB_8(Oj)`. That pins
  the register construction against the spec's own table rather than only the final ciphertext.
* Also verified against the **2138 NIST ACVP `ACVP-AES-CFB8` AFT cases** from `bc-test-data` (all
  three key lengths, both directions, 60 of them 16 to 160 bytes), each run in four groupings --
  whole message, byte by byte, 8-byte calls and 3-byte calls that never line up with the batch.
  The 6 MCT groups are skipped and the count reported. These vectors were already in
  `bc-test-data` and previously unused.
* Appendix D error propagation is checked in the form that distinguishes CFB8 from CFB128. Table
  D.2 gives "SBE in the decryption of Cj" plus "RBE in ... Cj+1,...,Cj+b/s", and `b/s` is **16**
  here rather than 1: with real AES, flipping a ciphertext bit flips exactly that bit of that
  plaintext byte, randomises the following 16 bytes, and then decryption **resynchronises
  exactly** -- byte `j + 17` onwards is required to be byte-identical to the original plaintext.
  That self-synchronisation is the property CFB8 is chosen for, and the equality assertion on the
  tail is what pins it.
* Interoperability checked byte for byte against OpenSSL's `EVP_aes_128_cfb8` on a 37-byte message,
  in both directions.

CTR (`Ctr`), SP 800-38A Sec 6.5:

* **The nonce is the init data, and its length picks the counter width.** Sec 6.5 needs a sequence
  of counter blocks that are distinct across every message under a key, and Appendix B.2's second
  approach builds each one as a message nonce followed by a counter: "if N is the message nonce for
  a given message, then the jth counter block is given by `Tj = N | [j]m`". `Ctr` takes that
  literally, splitting the block by the length of its init data: the init data *is* the nonce, and
  the remaining `BLOCK_LEN - INIT_DATA_LEN` bytes are the counter. The counter is capped at **4
  bytes** and must be at least 1, both checked at compile time, so on AES the nonce is 12, 13, 14 or
  15 bytes and a wrong one is a compile error rather than a runtime `Err`.
* **The counter starts at zero**, i.e. `Tj = N | [j - 1]m`, one below B.2's `[j]m`. Appendix B
  presents B.2 as one of "Two examples of approaches" and closes by allowing "other methods and
  approaches for achieving the uniqueness property", so both indexings satisfy the only normative
  requirement, that the blocks be distinct. Zero is what makes a nonce-with-zero-counter vector line
  up with an implementation handed the whole block as an IV -- which is how the ACVP vectors are
  written, and how OpenSSL is driven.
* **Running out of counter is an error, and nothing is consumed.** A `CTR_LEN`-byte counter gives
  `2^(8 * CTR_LEN)` blocks -- 64 GiB for a 4-byte counter, 4 KiB for a 1-byte one -- and Appendix
  B.1 bounds a message at exactly that ("provided that `n <= 2^m`"). Past it the counter would
  repeat, which for a keystream mode is keystream reuse *within one message*. `Ctr` therefore checks
  the whole call up front and returns `SymmetricCipherError::StateError` without touching the data,
  so a message is never half-encrypted before the mode notices. This is the first and only use in
  the crate of the `Result` the data methods have always returned; CBC, CFB, CFB8 and ECB never fail
  them. The counter is held as a `u64` rather than as the counter bytes precisely so that exhaustion
  is representable: the counter field itself wraps.
* **Both directions are parallel**, the only mode here of which that is true. Sec 6.5: "In both CTR
  encryption and CTR decryption, the forward cipher functions can be performed in parallel."
  Counter blocks depend on nothing but the nonce and the index, so encryption batches through
  `encrypt_4blocks` / `encrypt_2blocks` exactly as decryption does, and encryption and decryption are
  the same operation. Only the forward cipher function is ever used, as in the CFB modes.
* The keystream block is the one buffer in this crate wrapped in `Secret`: a call may end part-way
  through a block and the remainder is kept for the next one, and unlike a chaining value that
  remainder is live key material for the bytes still to come. 224/256/288 B for AES-128/192/256 with
  a 12-byte nonce.
* Verified against **1853 of the 2138 NIST ACVP `ACVP-AES-CTR` AFT cases** (all three key lengths,
  both directions), each in four groupings. The other 285 begin at a non-zero counter and so cannot
  be expressed through a nonce-plus-zero-counter API; they are skipped with the count reported.
* **Every ACVP case is a single block**, so none of them exercises the counter increment at all --
  a mode whose counter never advanced, or advanced little-endian, passes the entire set. (Checked,
  not assumed: a deliberately little-endian counter was run against the ACVP suite while these tests
  were written, and passed.) Two things close that gap. `ctr_vector_tests.rs` adds five-block
  vectors for all three key lengths generated with **OpenSSL 3.0.13**, whose last block is partial
  so they also pin Sec 6.5's `MSB_u(On)`; and `ctr_tests.rs` checks the counter blocks against the
  raw permutation **at all four counter widths**, across the 255-to-256 carry where the width allows
  it. That width sweep matters because the counter occupies a width-dependent slice, and getting it
  wrong is invisible to a round-trip test: both directions would build the same wrong block and
  still recover the plaintext.
* Cross-checked against **BC Java's `SICBlockCipher`**, which is the closest comparison available:
  unlike OpenSSL, whose `-aes-*-ctr` takes the whole block as its IV and so has no notion of a
  nonce, `SICBlockCipher` is built the same way -- a short IV goes in the leading bytes, the rest is
  zero-filled so the counter starts at 0, it increments big-endian with carry, and it throws
  `IllegalStateException("Counter in CTR/SIC mode out of range.")` once the carry would reach the
  IV. Same construction, same start, same overflow rule; the only difference is that BC Java caps
  the counter at `min(8, blockSize / 2)` bytes where this type stops at 4, so ours is a subset and
  the two agree exactly on nonces of 12 to 15 bytes. Agreement is byte for byte on the 69-byte
  vectors and on a 5000-byte message across the 255-to-256 carry at all three key lengths, and the
  counter limit falls on the same byte at both the 1-byte (4 KiB) and 2-byte (1 MiB) widths.
  `ctr_bc_java_tests.rs` pins what neither the ACVP nor the OpenSSL suite can reach: the keystream
  at **1, 2 and 3-byte counters**, including both ends of the 1-byte counter's range and the
  2-byte counter's carry from block 255 to 256.
* SP 800-38A **Appendix F.5** is not transcribed: its vectors start the counter at `0xfcfdfeff`
  rather than zero, so they cannot be expressed through this API. What F.5 does corroborate is the
  split -- across its four blocks the counter moves only within the last four bytes, leaving the
  leading twelve fixed -- and a test pins that reading.
* The counter limit is tested at two widths: a 1-byte counter (256 blocks, 4 KiB) and a 2-byte one
  (65536 blocks, 1 MiB), in both directions, including that a refused call leaves the data and the
  counter untouched so the bytes that do fit are unaffected by the attempt.

`cli`: twelve new subcommands -- `aes{128,192,256}-cbc`, `-cfb`, `-cfb8` and `-ctr` -- each taking
`encrypt` or `decrypt` and streaming stdin to stdout in 1 KiB chunks.

* The mode-independent plumbing lives once, in two halves that share their key loading and their
  `encrypt` / `decrypt` spelling. `cli/src/block_mode_cmd.rs` holds the block half -- stdin framing
  with block-alignment enforcement, hex/binary output -- generic over `BlockCipherEncryptor` /
  `BlockCipherDecryptor`; `cli/src/stream_mode_cmd.rs` holds the stream half, generic over
  `StreamCipherEncryptor` / `StreamCipherDecryptor`, which buffers nothing to a boundary and
  rejects no length. `aes_cbc_cmd.rs`, `aes_ecb_cmd.rs`, `aes_cfb_cmd.rs` and `aes_cfb8_cmd.rs` are
  thin dispatchers, so the commands cannot drift apart on the parts that affect correctness.
* Key from `--key` (hex) or `--key-file` (binary or hex), with the usual note that secrets on the
  command line end up in shell history. The key length must match the variant exactly.
* **The IV travels in the ciphertext**: since there is no API for supplying one, `encrypt` writes
  the generated IV as the first 16 bytes of its output and `decrypt` reads it back from the first
  16 bytes of its input, so `encrypt | decrypt` composes with no `--iv` flag anywhere. The IV need
  not be secret (SP 800-38A Sec 5.3), so this is sound.
* Input to the `-cbc` and `-ecb` commands must be a whole number of 16-byte blocks; unaligned input
  is rejected with a message saying the commands apply no padding rather than being silently
  padded. The `-cfb` and `-cfb8` commands take **any length** and pad nothing, because they are
  stream ciphers; their output is exactly as long as their input.
* The `-cfb` commands are **CFB128** and the `-cfb8` commands are **CFB8**, and every subcommand's
  help names its segment size and says the two are not interoperable, because they would otherwise
  silently produce incompatible output.
* The `-ctr` commands write a **12-byte nonce**, not the 16-byte IV every other mode writes, so
  their output is 12 bytes longer than their input rather than 16. The per-command help says so, and
  `cli/tests/aes_ctr_cli_tests.rs` (21 tests) pins it along with the OpenSSL vectors end to end,
  CTR's total malleability (a flipped ciphertext bit flips exactly one plaintext bit and disturbs
  nothing else), and that a CFB command cannot read a CTR ciphertext.
* Reads need not respect block boundaries: bytes accumulate in a 1 KiB buffer that goes through the flat
  `do_*_out::<1024>` when full, and the whole-block remainder at end of input goes one block at a time; verified by
  round-tripping 64 KiB through `dd bs=3`.
* Verified against SP 800-38A F.2 (CBC), F.3.13/F.3.15/F.3.17 (CFB128) and F.3.7/F.3.9/F.3.11
  (CFB8): prepending the spec's IV to the spec's ciphertext and running `decrypt` reproduces the
  spec's plaintext for all three key lengths in every mode. The `encrypt` direction was
  cross-checked against OpenSSL under the IV the CLI generated -- for CBC, and for both CFB modes
  on a 37-byte (deliberately unaligned) message, where our ciphertext and `openssl enc
  -aes-128-cfb` / `-aes-128-cfb8` agree byte for byte and each tool decrypts the other's output.
* `cli/tests/aes_cbc_cli_tests.rs` (16 tests) drives the built binary as a subprocess via
  `CARGO_BIN_EXE_bc-rust`, so all of the above is asserted by `cargo test` rather than by hand:
  the F.2 vectors, round trips across the chunk boundary, a fresh IV per invocation, hex/binary
  agreement, `--key-file` in both hex and binary, and every error path with its message.
* `cli/tests/aes_cfb_cli_tests.rs` (21 tests) mirrors that suite -- the shared plumbing is generic
  over the mode, so a wiring mistake in the CFB dispatcher would not show up in the CBC tests -- and
  adds four CFB-specific checks: the F.3 vectors, the Appendix D single-bit malleability observed
  end to end through the pipe, a guard that a CFB ciphertext does not decrypt as CBC or vice
  versa (neither mode is authenticated, so the mismatch is otherwise silent), and that every length
  from 0 to 33 bytes round-trips with the ciphertext exactly as long as the plaintext.
* `cli/tests/aes_cfb8_cli_tests.rs` (19 tests) does the same for CFB8, including the F.3.7/9/11
  vectors, every length from 0 to 33 bytes, and the Appendix D window: a flipped ciphertext bit
  flips the same bit of the same plaintext byte, corrupts the next 16 bytes, and then the output is
  required to be byte-identical to the original again.

ECB (`Ecb`), SP 800-38A Sec 6.1:

* **The raw permutation with the mode API, for interoperability only.** `Ecb<P, Dir, KEY_LEN, BLOCK_LEN>` implements
  `BlockCipherEncryptor` / `BlockCipherDecryptor` with `INIT_DATA_LEN = 0`: `do_encrypt_init` returns an empty array and
  draws nothing from the RNG, `do_decrypt_init` takes one. Same direction typing, streaming and one-shot methods,
  compile-time length checks and padding-layer composition as `Cbc` / `Cfb`, so a key-wrapping scheme, a legacy protocol
  or a test-vector harness that needs ECB can use it through the same interface. The crate docs, the type docs and the
  CLI help all say the same thing about it: **not a confidentiality mode for data** (Sec 6.1: "any given plaintext block
  always gets encrypted to the same ciphertext block"). One block smaller than `Cbc` / `Cfb`, since nothing chains
  (176 / 208 / 240 B for AES-128/192/256).
* **Both directions batch.** Sec 6.1 allows forward and inverse cipher calls "to be computed in parallel", so encryption
  as well as decryption walks the blocks through `ElectronicCodeBook::{en,de}crypt_4blocks`, then the pair methods, then
  a single block. The swapped-pair and rotated-four test permutations prove both paths are taken in both directions.
* `aes128-ecb` / `aes192-ecb` / `aes256-ecb` CLI subcommands over the shared block-mode plumbing, which is now generic
  over `INIT_DATA_LEN`: nothing is prepended on `encrypt` or consumed on `decrypt`, so output is exactly as long as
  input. The per-command help carries the warning.
* Verified against all six SP 800-38A **Appendix F.1** vectors (ECB-AES128/192/256, Encrypt and Decrypt) in five
  groupings each -- and, since there is no IV, `encrypt` is checked against the published ciphertext too, through the
  streaming API and the one-shot. Each tabulated ciphertext block is also checked to be `CIPH_K` of its plaintext block
  through the raw permutation. The **NIST ACVP `ACVP-AES-ECB`** set (2138 AFT cases) already used by `aes`
  is run again through the mode API, both directions, in three groupings including one that reaches the four-block
  path. Structural tests pin the Sec 6.1 equations against a reference over the toy permutation, determinism and the
  codebook property, Appendix D error propagation (a corrupted block randomises itself and nothing else, checked over
  all 128 bit positions with real AES), the empty init data, and composition with `bouncycastle-padding`.

`core`: new `ElectronicCodeBook<KEY_LEN, BLOCK_LEN>` trait (`crypto/core/src/traits.rs`), the raw
keyed permutation -- `CIPH_K` / `CIPH^-1_K` of SP 800-38A Sec 5.1 -- that a mode is built on.
`new`, `encrypt_block`, `decrypt_block`, plus provided `encrypt_2blocks` / `decrypt_2blocks` that
default to two single-block calls and `encrypt_4blocks` / `decrypt_4blocks` that default to two pair
calls, all of which bit-sliced implementations override (AES the pair form, SM4 both). The block methods
are infallible; only `new` can fail, and only on the key. `bouncycastle-aes` implements
it for all three key lengths (the data-encryption traits are still deliberately not implemented
there).

`core`: new `SimpleCipherEncryptor<KEY_LEN, INIT_DATA_LEN, FINAL_LEN>` and
`SimpleCipherDecryptor<KEY_LEN, INIT_DATA_LEN, FINAL_LEN>` traits, the arbitrary-length data API a
caller uses, as opposed to the block-aligned `BlockCipher*` traits a mode implements. Their shape is
taken from `PaddedEncryptor` / `PaddedDecryptor`, which now implement them: streaming
`do_{en,de}crypt_init[_rng]`, exact `update_out_len`, `do_update_out`, and a consuming `do_final` that
returns the `FINAL_LEN` trailing buffer (the padded block; a tag for an AEAD) paired with how many of its
bytes are output -- always `FINAL_LEN` except for a padding scheme that adds nothing to aligned data --
and, for the decryptor, how many of them are data. `do_final_out`, the `_out` one-shots
(`encrypt_out[_rng]`, `decrypt_out`, with `encrypt_out_len` exact and `decrypt_out_max_len` an upper
bound, checked before any work is done) and the `std` `Vec` one-shots are provided over the streaming
methods, so an implementor writes six methods.

The older one-shot-only `SymmetricCipher` trait is **deleted**, and its four methods -- `encrypt`,
`encrypt_out`, `decrypt`, `decrypt_out` -- move onto `AEADCipher`, which was its only remaining
user. Every other kind of cipher now reaches an arbitrary-length one-shot some other way: a block
mode through `SimpleCipherEncryptor` / `SimpleCipherDecryptor` and the padding adapters, a
stream mode through those same traits directly. `AEADCipher` therefore drops the supertrait and
declares the four itself, against `NONCE_LEN`, with the documentation saying what they mean for an
AEAD: no additional authenticated data, and a ciphertext layout that is the implementation's
business because the tag has to go somewhere. `TestFrameworkSimpleCipher::test`, which was that
trait's suite, moves to `TestFrameworkAEADCipher::test_plain_one_shots` and is called from
`TestFrameworkAEADCipher::test`, so an AEAD implementor keeps the coverage without asking for it.

That move also closed the last of a latent bug recorded in `core-test-framework/summary.md`: two
security-strength loops unwrapped `set_security_strength` at all five strengths, which a key shorter
than 32 bytes cannot carry, so they would have panicked for the first AEAD implementor — ASCON-128
and AES-128-GCM among them. Relocating one of them into a method the AEAD suite calls would have
made that worse, so both now carry the same key-length guard the block and stream suites already
had. Every strength loop in the file is guarded.

Stream ciphers also reach the arbitrary-length API: `StreamCipherEncryptor` and
`StreamCipherDecryptor` get blanket impls of `SimpleCipherEncryptor` / `SimpleCipherDecryptor`
with `FINAL_LEN = 0`, written in terms of the in-place `do_encrypt` / `do_decrypt`. An implementor
still writes only the in-place methods, but a caller can use `encrypt_out`, `do_update_out` and the
`std` one-shots, and can hold a stream mode through the same trait as a padded block mode -- which
is what makes "any of the five modes behind one trait" true rather than aspirational. For a stream
cipher the length predictions are exact rather than upper bounds, and `do_final` has nothing to
produce. The one cost is that both traits then spell `do_encrypt_init` identically, so code with
both in scope must qualify the call; `crypto/modes/tests/simple_cipher_api_tests.rs` is written
that way deliberately, to show it is workable. That file also runs all three stream modes through
`TestFrameworkSimpleCipher::test_encryptor_decryptor`, the same conformance suite the padded
adapters run, and checks the separate-output API against the in-place one byte for byte.

Mutation-tested with `--test-workspace`, which is what these blanket impls need: run against core's
own tests alone they look untested, because core has no implementors of its own traits. Scoped to
the change, 45 mutants, 22 caught, 19 unviable, 4 missed -- all four the same equivalent mutant,
`[]` against `[0; 0]` and `[1; 0]` for a zero-length array, which no test can distinguish because
they are the same value; both sites carry a comment saying so. The one genuinely uncovered mutant
the run found, the decryptor's output-buffer length comparison, is now covered.

`StreamCipher` is **replaced** by the split pair `StreamCipherEncryptor` / `StreamCipherDecryptor`,
shaped like `BlockCipherEncryptor` / `BlockCipherDecryptor` and for the same reasons: the direction
is encoded in the type, and a policy can permit decryption of an algorithm while forbidding new
encryptions. The old trait carried both directions and a `BLOCK_LEN` const parameter on every data
method, which a stream cipher has no use for; the new pair takes a `&mut [u8]` of any length, works
in place, generates its own init data in the constructor (never accepting one), and provides its
one-shots over a single implementor hook per direction. `Cfb` and `Cfb8` are its first implementors.

Testing:

* `core-test-framework` gains `TestFrameworkSimpleCipher::test_encryptor_decryptor`, which pins the
  paired contract: one-shot round trips at every length up to a few final chunks, the `std` one-shots
  against the `_out` ones, streaming in eight chunkings with `update_out_len` exact on every call,
  `do_final_out` against `do_final`, a driven RNG reproducing its init data and determining the
  ciphertext, corruption detection, short output buffers refused with the required length, and the
  key-type and security-strength policy. The padded adapters run it.
* `core-test-framework` gains `TestFrameworkElectronicCodeBook`, which pins the trait contract:
  both directions are inverses either way round, the permutation is injective, and the pair
  methods are indistinguishable from two single-block calls **including their order** -- the check
  that makes an override safe.
* Fixed a latent bug in `TestFrameworkBlockCipher`: it unwrapped `set_security_strength` at all
  five strengths, which a key shorter than 32 bytes cannot carry, so the framework panicked for
  any 16- or 24-byte key. It now skips the strengths the key length cannot hold. The bug was
  invisible until now because nothing in the workspace implemented the block cipher traits. The
  identical loop in `TestFrameworkSimpleCipher` and `TestFrameworkAEADCipher` got the same fix in
  the same PR, and each also gained a `strengths_tested > 0` assertion so the sweep cannot silently
  become vacuous again. `bouncycastle-ascon`'s `AsconAead128Encryptor`/`AsconAead128Decryptor`
  (16-byte key) are now the first implementors to actually exercise the AEAD suite's guard.
* `TestFrameworkStreamCipher::test` was a `todo!()` and is now implemented for the
  `StreamCipherEncryptor` / `StreamCipherDecryptor` pair, carrying the same key-length guard as the
  block suite from the start. It pins the paired contract: one-shot round trips, streaming in nine
  chunkings checked against the one-shot and against every other chunking (including empty calls,
  so a call may end mid-segment), the RNG-taking constructors reproducing their init data and
  determining the ciphertext, distinct init data across runs, the wrong key type rejected in both
  directions, and the security-strength policy. `Cfb` and `Cfb8` both run it.

* Block cipher padding (PR #97):
    * padding -- new crate (`bouncycastle-padding`, no_std, re-exported as `bouncycastle::padding`) providing `PKCS7`,
      the padding scheme of RFC 5652 s. 6.3, for any block length 1..=255 (enforced at compile time). `unpad` examines
      every byte with `Condition<i64>` mask arithmetic and has a single public decision point, so it does not leak a
      padding oracle through timing or error detail.
    * `PaddedEncryptor<E, P>` / `PaddedDecryptor<D, P>` adapt a block-aligned `BlockCipherEncryptor` /
      `BlockCipherDecryptor` to arbitrary-length data: streaming `do_update_out` / `do_final(self)` plus one-shot
      `encrypt_out` / `decrypt_out`, with exact output-length helpers. The buffered partial plaintext block is held in
      a `Secret`, and the decryptor withholds one complete block until `do_final`, since only the last block carries
      padding.
    * `core` gains the `Padding<const BLOCK_LEN>` trait (in-place `pad(block, data_len)`, constant-time
      `unpad(block) -> data_len`, and `ALWAYS_PADS`, whether the scheme appends a block to already-aligned data) and
      `PaddingError { DataLengthTooLong, InvalidPadding, PaddingNotPermitted }`, wrapped as a new variant of
      `SymmetricCipherError`.
    * `NoPadding`: the absence of padding as a `Padding` scheme, for data that must already be a whole number of
      blocks. `pad` never writes a byte and returns `PaddingNotPermitted` whenever called; `unpad` reports the whole
      block as data; `ALWAYS_PADS` is false. Through `PaddedEncryptor` / `PaddedDecryptor` this *enforces* alignment
      with the arbitrary-length API shape: an aligned message passes through with its length unchanged and no final
      block, an unaligned one fails at `do_final` / `encrypt_out`, and an empty ciphertext decrypts to the empty
      message. The test framework's `TestFrameworkSimpleCipher` gained `required_alignment`, which makes it assert
      that every unaligned length is refused.
    * Tests are derived from the RFC 5652 padding rule; the adapters are driven with a toy XOR-CBC cipher implementing
      the new block cipher traits, covering every data length, ten chunkings in both directions, tampering, malformed
      lengths, and buffer sizing. Criterion bench included.
* New algorithms added to crypto/ :
    * SM3 -- the SM3 hash (GB/T 32905-2016 / ISO/IEC 10118-3:2018), ported from bc-java.
    * AES -- AES-128/192/256, along with its modes AES_ECB, AES_CBC, AES_GCM.

`core`: new `AEADCipherEncryptor<KEY_LEN, NONCE_LEN, TAG_LEN, FINAL_LEN>` and
`AEADCipherDecryptor<KEY_LEN, NONCE_LEN, TAG_LEN, FINAL_LEN>` traits (#119/#120), the streaming API
for an authenticated cipher, shaped like `SimpleCipherEncryptor` / `SimpleCipherDecryptor` (separate
input/output buffers, exact `update_out_len`, generated nonce) with the two things authentication
adds: an AAD phase (`do_update_aad`, repeatable before the first `do_update_out`, refused with
`StateError` once data has started) and a finalizer that also produces the tag
(`do_encrypt_final`/`do_decrypt_final`, flushing up to `FINAL_LEN` held-back bytes alongside it).
`FINAL_LEN` is `0` for a cipher like Ascon-AEAD128 that never buffers; a block-oriented AEAD or one
whose wire format inlines the tag would need it non-zero. The one-shots (`encrypt_out[_rng]`,
`decrypt_out`, and the `std` `Vec` forms) are provided over the streaming methods, so an implementor
writes seven. `bouncycastle-ascon`'s `AsconAead128Encryptor` / `AsconAead128Decryptor` are the first
implementors.

Mutation-tested with `cargo mutants -p bouncycastle-core -F 'AEADCipher(Encryptor|Decryptor)'
--test-package bouncycastle-ascon` (`core` has no implementor of its own to test against): 68
mutants, 49 caught, 10 unviable, 9 missed -- all nine equivalent given `FINAL_LEN = 0`, the only
value Ascon-AEAD128 exercises. Six are `written + final_len` vs `written - final_len` in
`encrypt_out`/`encrypt_out_rng`/`decrypt_out`'s final-buffer splice, indistinguishable because
`final_len` is always `0` there; the other three are the one-shots' own buffer-length guard
(`plaintext.len() < needed` / `ciphertext.len() < needed`) against `>`, indistinguishable because
`needed` at `FINAL_LEN = 0` is exactly the bound Ascon's own `do_update_out` already enforces one
call deeper, so the outer guard's direction is never the only thing standing between a short buffer
and an error. A future `FINAL_LEN > 0` implementor (a block-oriented AEAD) would give both classes
of mutant something to bite on.

Where the tag goes is deliberately not fixed by the pair (contrast `AEADCipher`, whose one-shots
pick a layout): `core::tagged_aead::TaggedEncryptor<E>` / `TaggedDecryptor<D, TAG_LEN>` adapt any
`FINAL_LEN = 0` implementor to `SimpleCipherEncryptor` / `SimpleCipherDecryptor`, producing and
consuming the inline `ciphertext || tag` layout most wire formats and files use, with the AAD phase
still reachable through an inherent `do_update_aad` the `SimpleCipher*` traits have no slot for.
`TaggedDecryptor` holds back exactly the last `TAG_LEN` bytes it has seen at any point, releasing
everything older through the wrapped decryptor as soon as it is known not to be the tag -- the same
technique `bc-rust`'s `ascon-aead128 --decrypt` used by hand before this adapter existed, now
provided once. (A fully general adapter over a implementor whose own `FINAL_LEN` is non-zero needs
this adapter's `FINAL_LEN` to be `INNER_FINAL_LEN + TAG_LEN`, a value derived from two other const
generics that stable const generics cannot express as a trait argument; left to a future adapter.)

New crate `bouncycastle-ascon` (`bouncycastle::ascon`): Ascon-AEAD128 / Ascon-Hash256 / Ascon-XOF128
/ Ascon-CXOF128 (NIST SP 800-232), the lightweight cryptography suite selected from the NIST
Lightweight Cryptography competition.

* `AsconAead128` is the streaming primitive (rate 128 bits, capacity 192 bits, `Ascon-p[12]` at
  init/finalization and `Ascon-p[8]` on AAD/data blocks), with a caller-supplied nonce for KAT and
  protocol use. Every plaintext/ciphertext byte is transformed and emitted the moment it is seen --
  no held-back buffering across calls -- because within a rate block each byte is independent of
  the others in it; this is what lets its finalizers have nothing left to flush.
  `AsconAead128Encryptor` / `AsconAead128Decryptor` are thin newtypes over it implementing the new
  `AEADCipherEncryptor` / `AEADCipherDecryptor` pair with an internally-generated nonce; `AsconAead128`
  itself keeps implementing the one-shot-only `AEADCipher` (both directions on one type, chosen by a
  runtime flag), which the newtype split cannot replace since that trait needs both directions
  available on a single implementor.
* `AsconHash256` (`Hash`) and `AsconXof128` (`XOF`) are sponge constructions over the same
  permutation; `AsconCXof128` (`XOF`) adds the customization string of SP 800-232 Algorithm 7 (up to
  256 bytes). All four are byte-oriented: `do_final_partial_bits`/the equivalent XOF methods always
  return an error rather than accept a partial final byte, unlike SHA-2/SHA-3. Registered in
  `HashFactory` (`"Ascon-Hash256"`) and `XOFFactory` (`"Ascon-XOF128"`), with `ascon-hash256`,
  `ascon-xof128`, `ascon-cxof128` and `ascon-aead128` CLI subcommands; the last streams both
  directions in 1 KiB chunks, decrypting through `TaggedDecryptor` rather than a hand-rolled tail
  buffer.
* **Decryption releases plaintext before the tag is checked**, streaming or through the CLI: bytes
  are necessarily written to the caller's buffer (or stdout) before the last `TAG_LEN` bytes -- the
  tag -- can be read and compared. A non-zero exit from the CLI, or an `Err` from the streaming
  finalizer, means the input was tampered with and any output already produced must be discarded;
  do not treat it as authentic before that point. The one-shot APIs (`AsconAead128::decrypt`, both
  `AEADCipher` and `AEADCipherDecryptor` views) do not have this caveat: they own the whole message
  and zeroize the output buffer before returning an error.
* Verified against 4228 NIST LWC KAT vectors from `bc-test-data` (1089 each for AEAD128 and
  CXOF128, 1025 each for Hash256 and XOF128), plus embedded always-on vectors for when that
  repository is not checked out. Mutation-tested with `cargo mutants -p bouncycastle-ascon`: 665
  mutants, 558 caught, 103 unviable, 4 missed -- all four the same equivalent survivors as the
  crate's introduction (PR #21): the `Sponge::absorb`/`squeeze` boundary pair and the disjoint-bit
  `set_state_byte` OR-vs-XOR pair, neither touched by the `AEADCipherEncryptor`/`AEADCipherDecryptor`
  work.

## Minor features / bug fixes

* Design discussions about whether core::traits::XOF (in the abstract) should allow interleaving absorb -> squeeze ->
  absorb (ie "absorb-after-squeeze). Outcome: absorb-after-squeeze forbidden. Could be changed in the future.
* SHA2:
    * Implemented SHA512/224 and SHA512/256.
    * `Hash::do_final_partial_bits()` / `do_final_partial_bits_out()` are now implemented for SHA-2 (FIPS 180-4 s. 5.1).
* SHA3:
    * Fixed a bug in `XOF::squeeze_partial_byte_final()`: when it was the first squeeze it bypassed the SHAKE `1111`
      domain suffix and returned raw Keccak output, and it returned the wrong `num_bits` bits of the output byte. The
      existing test used
      `0xFF`, which masked the second error.
    * Changed the order of bits when absorbing a final partial byte to match ASN.1 DER BIT_STRING bit ordering.
