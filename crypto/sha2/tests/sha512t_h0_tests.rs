//! FIPS 180-4 s. 5.3.6 known-answer tests for the SHA-512/t IV Generation Function.
//!
//! The initial hash value H(0) for SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 is not stored as a literal in this
//! crate: it is produced by the IV Generation Function (FIPS 180-4 s. 5.3.6), evaluated at compile
//! time. These tests pin what that function produces against the words the standard lists in
//! s. 5.3.6.1 and s. 5.3.6.2.
//!
//! H(0) is read back through the public suspend API rather than from a crate-private constant. A
//! freshly-constructed hash has processed no message, so the chaining value in its serialized state
//! is still H(0). The layout is a 3-byte library version tag (written by
//! `bouncycastle_core::suspendable_state::add_lib_ver`) followed by the eight 64-bit chaining
//! words, little-endian.
//!
//! Note that a wrong H(0) is also caught end-to-end by the CAVP vectors in `bc-test-data.rs`, since
//! every SHA-512/224 and SHA-512/256 digest would then differ. These tests localize such a failure
//! to the IV Generation Function itself.
