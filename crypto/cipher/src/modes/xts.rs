//! XTS, the "XEX Tweakable Block Cipher with Ciphertext Stealing" (SP 800-38E Sec 3), as IEEE Std
//! 1619-2007 Sec 5 specifies it for AES and NIST SP 800-38E approves it, over any 128-bit block
//! permutation.
//!
//! XTS encrypts one *data unit* -- a disk sector, say -- under a key and a 128-bit *tweak* that
//! names the data unit's position, and the ciphertext is exactly as long as the plaintext: there
//! is no IV, no nonce, no padding and no tag. A data unit is at least one block, 16 bytes
//! (IEEE 1619-2007 Sec 5.1), and at most 2^20 blocks, 16 MiB, a limit that Sec 5.1 recommends and
//! SP 800-38E Sec 4 requires: "The length of the data unit for any instance of an implementation
//! of XTS-AES shall not exceed 2^20 AES blocks". A data unit that is not a whole number of blocks
//! is encrypted with ciphertext stealing, so its ciphertext is as long as it is. IEEE 1619
//! measures a data unit in bits; this implementation takes whole bytes, a restriction that
//! SP 800-38E Sec 4 allows an implementation to make.
//!
//! The key is [`XTSKey`], built with `from_key_material` from the XTS key `Key = Key_1 | Key_2`
//! (IEEE 1619-2007 Sec 5.3.1): two keys for the permutation, `Key_1` encrypting the data and
//! `Key_2` the tweak, so 32 bytes over a permutation with a 16-byte key and 64 over one with a
//! 32-byte key, the 256- and 512-bit keys of XTS-AES-128 and XTS-AES-256 (Sec 6). The data-unit
//! length is the key type's `DATA_UNIT_LEN`, because SP 800-38E Sec 4 defines an instance of
//! XTS-AES by "a secret key" and "a single, fixed length for the data units that the key
//! protects"; a length outside the range is a compile error. The ready-made `XTS_AES_128` /
//! `XTS_AES_256` aliases are in `bouncycastle-aes`. IEEE 1619 specifies XTS for AES only, and AES
//! is the only cipher SP 800-38E approves it for.
//!
//! # The tweak
//!
//! The tweak value `i` is the data unit's position, a non-negative integer; the data units under
//! a key take consecutive values from any first one, typically the logical block address of the
//! first sector (IEEE 1619-2007 Sec 5.1, Sec 6). The methods take `i` as the 16 bytes that are
//! encrypted under `Key_2`, which Sec 5.1 makes its little-endian encoding: `i.to_le_bytes()` for
//! a `u128` `i`, so sector 255's tweak is `FF 00 .. 00`.
//!
//! # Usage Examples
//!
//! Over `ToyBlockCipher` (see the [module docs](super) for why); `bouncycastle-aes`'s aliases
//! carry examples over AES with published vectors:
//!
//! ```
//! # mod toy { include!("../../tests/common/toy_block_cipher.rs"); }
//! # use toy::ToyBlockCipher;
//! use bouncycastle_cipher::modes::XTSKey;
//! use bouncycastle_core::key_material::{KeyMaterial, KeyType};
//! use bouncycastle_core::symmetric_key::FromKeyMaterial;
//!
//! // Key = Key_1 | Key_2: 32 bytes over a permutation with a 16-byte key, the two halves distinct.
//! let key_bytes: [u8; 32] = core::array::from_fn(|i| i as u8 + 1);
//! let material = KeyMaterial::<32>::from_bytes_as_type(&key_bytes, KeyType::SymmetricCipherKey)
//!     .expect("a 32-byte symmetric cipher key");
//!
//! // 512-byte data units: the length is part of the key's type.
//! let key = XTSKey::<ToyBlockCipher, 512>::from_key_material(&material).expect("an XTS key");
//!
//! let mut sector = [0x5Au8; 512];
//! let tweak = 7u128.to_le_bytes(); // the data unit's sequence number
//! assert_eq!(key.encrypt_inplace(&tweak, &mut sector), 512);
//! assert_ne!(sector, [0x5Au8; 512]);
//! assert_eq!(key.decrypt_inplace(&tweak, &mut sector), 512);
//! assert_eq!(sector, [0x5Au8; 512]);
//! ```
//!
//! # 🚨 Security Considerations 🚨
//!
//! ## XTS provides confidentiality only
//!
//! SP 800-38E's abstract: "The mode does not provide authentication of the data or its source." A
//! changed ciphertext block decrypts to an unpredictable plaintext block rather than to an error,
//! and an older ciphertext of a data unit decrypts to the older plaintext. Each 16-byte block is
//! encrypted on its own under its position's mask, so someone who sees two versions of a data
//! unit learns which of its blocks changed, and the same plaintext under the same key and tweak
//! always gives the same ciphertext; IEEE 1619-2007 Annex D.2 and D.3 discuss these limits. Where
//! any of that matters, authenticate the data, or use an AEAD, which a format that can store a
//! nonce and a tag should.
//!
//! ## XTS is for storage
//!
//! SP 800-38E Sec 3: "The XTS-AES mode was not designed for other purposes, such as the
//! encryption of data in transit", and FIPS 140-3 IG C.I: "AES-XTS is only approved for storage
//! purposes."
//!
//! ## One key scope per key
//!
//! IEEE 1619-2007 Sec 6 allows a key only one *key scope*: a run of data units of one length
//! under consecutive tweak values, so every data unit under the key has its own tweak. Two data
//! units encrypted under one key and one tweak are encrypted under the same masks, so a block that
//! is equal in both, at the same offset, has an equal ciphertext in both, and a ciphertext block
//! of one can be pasted into the other. A key type keeps to one length, its `DATA_UNIT_LEN`; a
//! second key type of another length made from the same material, or a second disk under the
//! same key, steps outside the key scope.
//!
//! ## A bounded amount of data per key
//!
//! The proof that IEEE 1619-2007 Annex D.4.3 (informative) cites gives a strong guarantee while a
//! key encrypts not much more than a terabyte, 2^36 blocks, and a weakening one beyond it; Annex
//! D.6 warns that a few hundred terabytes under one key make attacks possible. The bound comes
//! from the 128-bit block, so a longer key does not raise it. Nothing here counts the blocks a key
//! has encrypted.
//!
//! ## `Key_1` and `Key_2` must be independent
//!
//! FIPS 140-3 IG C.I requires `Key_1` and `Key_2` to be "generated and/or established
//! independently", and a module to "check explicitly that Key_1 ≠ Key_2": with equal halves, XTS
//! falls to a chosen-ciphertext attack. The key's constructor refuses equal halves, and one of
//! all zeros, but it cannot check independence. Draw the whole key from an RNG, with
//! `FromKeyMaterial::generate`, rather than deriving one half from the other.
