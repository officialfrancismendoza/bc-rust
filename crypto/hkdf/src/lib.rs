//! The generic HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF) construction, as per
//! RFC 5869, as allowed by NIST SP 800-56Cr2.
//!
//! This is a utility crate and is not intended to be used directly. It provides [`HKDF`] -- the
//! construction, generic over any struct that implements [`Hash`] and [`HashAlgParams`], the extension
//! point through which a hash declares the metadata from which the HKDF instance is built.
//! The library provides the following concrete instantiations of HKDF:
//!
//! | Hash family | Instantiations                                                |
//! |-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | SHA-2       | `bouncycastle_sha2::hkdf` -- `HKDF_SHA256`, `HKDF_SHA512`     |
//!
//! # Instantiating HKDF over a hash
//!
//! HKDF uses HMAC as its underlying primitive, so it works with any hash that HMAC works with:
//! [`HKDF`] needs only [`Hash`] + [`HashAlgParams`] + [`Default`]. Unlike HMAC there is no additional
//! HKDF params trait to implement -- HKDF has no per-hash OIDs and derives its name from nothing --
//! so an instantiation is just a type alias plus, by convention, a name constant and a suspended-state
//! length.
//!
//! What the alias has to supply is [`HKDF`]'s two const parameters:
//!
//! * `HASH_STATE_LEN` -- the hash's own suspended-state length, i.e. the `N` in
//!   `H: Suspendable<N>`.
//! * `HKDF_STATE_LEN` -- this HKDF's suspended-state length, which is always `HASH_STATE_LEN + 14`.
//!
//! Both are const parameters of the struct rather than being derived from the hash because
//! [`SuspendableKeyed`] takes its length as a const generic, and naming `HASH_STATE_LEN + 14` in that
//! position requires the unstable `generic_const_exprs` feature. Carrying both on the struct is what
//! lets a single blanket [`SuspendableKeyed`] impl serve every hash while still pinning the two
//! lengths together per concrete type. They are given no defaults on purpose: there is no value that
//! is correct for more than one hash, so each instantiation states them. Getting the pair wrong is a
//! compile error at the point of use, not a silent mis-sizing -- the blanket impl only applies when
//! `HASH_STATE_LEN` really is the hash's `Suspendable` length.
//!
//! One limitation to be aware of when instantiating over a hash of your own: the extract phase
//! writes its pseudorandom key into a [`MAX_HMAC_OUTPUT_LEN`]-byte buffer, so the hash's output
//! length must not exceed that (64 bytes). See the note on that constant.
//!
//! ## Worked example
//!
//! As an example, the `bouncycastle-sha2` crate instantiates HKDF-SHA256 and HKDF-SHA512 this way. The library does not ship
//! HKDF-SHA384, so that makes a good illustration of adding one -- for a hash in this library or for
//! a hash of your own, the shape is identical:
//!
//! ```
//! use bouncycastle_core::key_material::{KeyMaterial256, KeyType};
//! use bouncycastle_core::traits::{KDF, SuspendableKeyed};
//! use bouncycastle_hkdf::HKDF;
//! use bouncycastle_sha2::{SHA384, SUSPENDED_SHA512_STATE_LEN};
//!
//! // SHA-384 is a member of the SHA-512 family, so its suspended state is the SHA-512 one.
//! const SUSPENDED_HKDF_SHA384_STATE_LEN: usize = SUSPENDED_SHA512_STATE_LEN + 14;
//!
//! #[allow(non_camel_case_types)]
//! pub type HKDF_SHA384 =
//!     HKDF<SHA384, SUSPENDED_SHA512_STATE_LEN, SUSPENDED_HKDF_SHA384_STATE_LEN>;
//!
//! pub const HKDF_SHA384_NAME: &str = "HKDF-SHA384";
//!
//! // That is all it takes: the KDF trait and the extract/expand API are now available.
//! let ikm = KeyMaterial256::from_bytes_as_type(
//!             b"\x00\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06\x07\x08\x09\x0a\x0b\x0c\x0d\x0e\x0f",
//!             KeyType::Seed).unwrap();
//! let okm = HKDF_SHA384::new().derive_key(&ikm, b"extra input").unwrap();
//!
//! // ...and so is suspend/resume, because SHA-384 implements Suspendable and the two const
//! // parameters above agree.
//! let salt = KeyMaterial256::from_bytes_as_type(
//!             b"\x0f\x0e\x0d\x0c\x0b\x0a\x09\x08\x07\x06\x05\x04\x03\x02\x01\x00",
//!             KeyType::MACKey).unwrap();
//! let mut hkdf = HKDF_SHA384::new();
//! hkdf.do_extract_init(&salt).unwrap();
//! hkdf.do_extract_update_bytes(b"part 1").unwrap();
//! let suspended = hkdf.suspend();
//! assert_eq!(suspended.len(), SUSPENDED_HKDF_SHA384_STATE_LEN);
//!
//! let mut resumed = HKDF_SHA384::from_suspended(suspended, &salt).unwrap();
//! resumed.do_extract_update_bytes(b"part 2").unwrap();
//! let _prk = resumed.do_extract_final().unwrap();
//! ```
//!
//! # Security Considerations
//!
//! These apply to every instantiation; `bouncycastle_sha2::hkdf` repeats the ones that matter most in
//! day-to-day use.
//!
//! * HKDF is keyed by its `salt`, which keys the extract-phase HMAC. The salt is deliberately
//!   excluded from the suspended state and must be re-supplied on resume; resuming with a different
//!   salt cannot be detected and silently produces a different PRK.
//! * Entropy is credited only for input supplied via [`HKDF::do_extract_update_key`]. Bytes supplied
//!   via [`HKDF::do_extract_update_bytes`] are treated as uncredited context, so a PRK derived only
//!   from raw bytes will not be tagged as full-entropy key material even if those bytes were random.
//!   [`HKDF::do_extract_update_key`] is rejected after the first call to
//!   [`HKDF::do_extract_update_bytes`], so that the input matches the ordering of the key-extraction
//!   method in NIST SP 800-133r2 Section 6.3, `K = T(HMAC-hash(salt, K1 || ... || Kn || D1 || ...
//!   || Dm), kLen)`, in which the component keys precede the other data. Note (h) of that method
//!   permits other orderings, so this is a deliberate restriction of this API rather than a
//!   requirement of the specification.
//! * HKDF stretches key material but does not create entropy. The output key inherits the
//!   [`SecurityStrength`] of its inputs: 200 bytes expanded from a 128-bit seed is 200 bytes at a
//!   128-bit security level, not a 1600-bit key.
//! * RFC 5869 Section 3.1 recommends a random salt where one is available. SP 800-56Cr2 permits an
//!   all-zero salt, and the extract phase accepts one, but a salt that the caller believes to be
//!   random and is not provides none of the benefit the recommendation is aimed at.
